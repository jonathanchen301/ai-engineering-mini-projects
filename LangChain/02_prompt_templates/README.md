Today the weather is super duper awesome! The sun is shining bright like a big, happy smile in the sky, and there are fluffy white clouds that look like cotton candy. It’s warm enough to wear my favorite t-shirt, but there’s a little breeze that feels like a gentle hug. I can hear the birds chirping and see butterflies dancing around the flowers. It’s the perfect day to play outside, ride my bike, or have a picnic with my friends! I just love when the weather is this nice!
